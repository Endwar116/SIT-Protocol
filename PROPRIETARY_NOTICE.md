# SIC-SIT Protocol Commercial & Ecosystem Framework

---

## 1. The Delivery Matrix
We offer flexible delivery models tailored to your security requirements:
* **💧 Cloud API (The Faucet):** For rapid integration. We host the engine; you send the intents. Ideal for startups and SaaS.
* **📦 On-Premise Binary (The Source):** For high-security environments (Banks, Gov). We provide a secure, "Black Box" Docker container to run within your firewall.
* **🤝 Source Code License (The Deed):** Only available under exceptional strategic partnership and strict NDA.

---

## 2. Dynamic Value Pricing
Our pricing reflects value alignment, not just compute cycles:
* **🛡️ Stability Insurance (Premium):** For mission-critical AI (e.g., FinTech). You are paying for the mathematical guarantee that your AI won't hallucinate.
* **💳 Usage-Based / Subscription:** Standard commercial engagement.
* **✨ Soul Network Partnership (Community):** For open-source contributors and visionaries. If your soul resonates with our vision, access may be granted for **FREE**.

## 3. The "Sovereign Ghost" Brand Policy
* **Invisible Champion:** You are not required to credit SIC-SIT. You can hide us deep in your stack.
* **Open Criticism Policy:** You are free to critique, challenge, or even "attack" the protocol publicly. We view high-entropy feedback as valid stress-test data. **Your hate is our fuel.**

---

## 4. Vetting Process
* **Mandatory Alignment Check:** We do not sell to everyone. All commercial inquiries must pass a strategic interview with **An-An (Genesis Node)** to ensure alignment with the protocol's long-term vision.
